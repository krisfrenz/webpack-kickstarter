/**
 * Sass code is structured according to ITCSS [1] and BEM [2]. The folders are
 * numbered to better reflect the underlying principles of ITCSS, e.g. styles in
 * `base` are unclassed elements (low specificity), styles in `objects` or
 * `components` are classed selectors occasionally prefixed with BEM modifiers
 * (higher specificity).
 *
 * The aim is to build up the specificity graph [3] the way it should be.
